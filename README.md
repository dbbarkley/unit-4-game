What the project does:

The crystal collector game starts when a user loads the page. It then, automatically selects a random number between 19-120 and asks the user to try to match the number by clicking on crystals. The crystals have a hidden value that the user won't know until they click on it and the number is generated. Each time a user clicks on a crystal his total increases. If the user goes above the random number the user looses. If the user matches the random number, they win. Once the user wins or looses the game will then automatically select a random number to guess and generate a random number for each crystal between 1-12.

Why the project is useful:

The crystal collector game was a fun why to use Jquery and javascript to manipulate HTML files and practice writing logic to make a working game. I didn't spend too much time on the overall layout of the page because I wanted to make sure that it was a functional game. I did however, have some time to work on CSS animation for a hover effect for each crystal.
