Link for Crystal Collector Game:

What the project does:

The crystal collector game starts when a user loads the page. It automatically selects a random number between 19-120 and asks the user to try to match the number by clicking on crystals. The crystals have a hidden value that the user won't know until they click on it andnumber is populated. Each time a user clicks on a crystal his total increases. If the user goes above the random number the user losses. If the user matches the random number, they win. Once th user wins/losses the game automatically selects a random number to guess, and selcts a random number for each crystal between 1-12.

Why the project is useful:

The crystal collector game was a fun why to use Jquery and javascript to manipulate HTML files and practice writing logic to make a working game. I didn't spend too much time on the overall layout of the page, I wanted to make sure that it was a functional game. I did have some time to work an CSS animation for a hover effect on each crystal.
